	When a humble bard<p>
	Graced a ride along<p>
	With Geralt of Rivia<p>
	Along came this song<p>

	From when the White Wolf fought<p>
	A silver-tongued devil<p>
	His army of elves<p>
	At his hooves did they revel<p>
	</div><div class = "textagot">
	They came after me<p>
	With masterful deceit<p>
	Broke down my lute<p>
	And they kicked in my teeth<p>

	While the devil’s horns<p>
	Minced our tender meat<p>
	And so cried the Witcher<p>
	"He can’t be bleat"<p>

	Toss a coin to your Witcher<p>

	O' Valley of Plenty, oh<p>
	Toss a coin to your Witcher<p>
	O' Valley of Plenty<p>

	At the edge of the world<p>
	Fight the mighty horn<p>
	That bashes and breaks you<p>
	And brings you to mourn<p>
</div><div class = "textagot">
	He thrust every elf<p>
	Far back on the shelf<p>
	High up on the mountain<p>
	From whence it came<p>

	Got kicked in his chest<p>
	He’s a friend of humanity<p>
	So give him the rest<p>
