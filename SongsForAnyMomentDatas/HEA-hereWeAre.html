	Once upon a time, I thought I'd always be in my mother's shadow<p>
	Answering for her crimes, I thought I'd always be in an endless battle<p>
	Until I began to hone<p>
	A power all my own<p>
	That I could feel growing stronger every day<p>
	And now I've saved the world<p>
	Not just that- the whole galaxy saved<p>
	We did it!<p>

	Once upon a time<p>
	I only lived to be of Pink Diamond's service<p>
	'Til the day the two of us snuck down to be on this planet's surface<p>
	We became our fantasy<p>
	And I was sure she set me free<p>
	But in the end, I guess I never left her side<p>
	And after love and loss and all the tears that I cried, I find that-<p></div>

	Once upon a time, a Sapphire came to Earth with her Ruby soldier<p>
	Sapphire's deadly fate was set until the Ruby rushed in to hold her<p>
	Suddenly they were fusing<p>
	Beautiful, strange, confusing<p>
	And there I was, a bundle of questions, so naive<p>
	That if you told me this I never would've believed you then but-<p>

	Once upon a time, I burst to life inside of the Kindergarten<p>
	A product of a war that I had no idea I had a part in<p>
	I came out late and alone<p>
	Knew nothing but my home<p>
	But I know now exactly who I'm s'posed to be<p>
	And it's a part of this family!<p></div>

	If I could just stop right here and be<p>
	Finally done<p>
	Finally us<p>
	Finally we are in the future<p>
	Here we are in the future and it's bright!<p>
	Nothing to fear<p>
	No one to fight<p>
	I can't believe we've come so far<p>
	Happily ever after<p>
